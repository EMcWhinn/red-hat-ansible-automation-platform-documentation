= Setting up a new decision environment

Decision Environments are a container image to run Ansible rulebooks.
They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and provide a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.
The default decision environment is found at link:https://quay.io/repository/ansible/ansible-rulebook[Ansible-Rulebook]. 

To create your own decision environment refer to [PLACEHOLDER FOR LINK TO KCS].

The following steps describe how to import a decision environment into your {EDAcontroller} Dashboard.

== Prerequisites

* You have set up a credential, if necessary. 
For more information, refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html[Credentials] section
