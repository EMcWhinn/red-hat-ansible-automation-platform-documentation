= Rulebook activation list view

On the *Rulebooks Activations* page you can view the rulebooks that you have created along with the *Activation status*, *Number of rules associated* with the rulebook, the *Fire count* and *Restart count*.

If the *Activation Status* is *Running*, it means that the rulebook activation or rulebook is constantly running in the background and executing the required action.

You can view more details by selecting the activation from the *Rulebook Activations* list view.

For example, if your activation has failed you can see the *Details* and *History* tabs.

Select the *History* tab to access the list of all the times the activation has been executed.
Then select the activation in question, this will show you the *Output* produced by that specific execution.
