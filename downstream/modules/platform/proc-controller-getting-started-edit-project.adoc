= Editing a project

For the purpose of getting started you can leave the default demo credential as it is, but you can edit it later.

.Procedure
. Go to the *Details* tab.
. Select btn:[Edit].

Alternatively, you can:

. Go to the *Projects* list view.
. Select btn[Edit] next to the project name and edit the appropriate details.
. Save your changes.

If you want to fetch the project for the latest changes, you can manually start an SCM sync for this project:

. Update the SCM-based demo project from the Details tab
. Select btn:[Sync].

Alternatively, you can:

. Go to the *Projects* list view.
. Select the Sync () button next to the project name.

[NOTE]
====
When you add a project set up to use source control, a “sync” automatically starts that fetches the project details from the configured source control.
