For example, if the organization that you created has a group of web server hosts supporting a particular application:

. Create a group and add the web server hosts, to add these hosts to the inventory.
. Click btn:[Cancel] (if no changes were made) or use the breadcrumb navigational links at the top of the automation controller browser to return to the *Inventories* list view. Clicking btn:[Save] does not exit the *Details* dialog.
