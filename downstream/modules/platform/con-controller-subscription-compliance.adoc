[id="controller-subscription-compliance"]

= Subscription compliance

A status of *Compliance* indicates your subscription is in compliance with the number of hosts you have automated within your subscription count. 
Otherwise, your status shows an *Out of Compliance* status, indicating you have exceeded the number of hosts in your subscription.

Even if a host is automated in multiple inventories, it counts against your subscription's allotted host count.

Compliance is computed as follows:

managed > manifest_limit        =>      non-compliant

managed =< manifest_limit       =>      compliant

Where `managed` is unique managed hosts without deletions. 
`Manifest_limit` is the number of managed hosts in the subscription manifest.

The following information is also displayed:

* *Hosts automated*: The host count automated by the job, which consumes the license count
* *Hosts imported*: The host count considering unique host names across all inventory sources (does not impact hosts remaining)
* *Hosts remaining*: The total host count minus hosts automated
* *Hosts deleted*: The hosts that were deleted, freeing the license capacity
* *Active hosts previously deleted*: The number of hosts now active that were previously deleted

For example, you have a subscription capacity of 10 hosts:

* Starting with 9 hosts, 2 hosts were added and 3 hosts were deleted, you now have 8 hosts (compliant).
* Three hosts were automated again, now you have 11 hosts, which puts you over the subscription limit of 10 (non-compliant).
* If you were to delete host(s), refresh the subscription details to see the change in count and status.

Click *Host Metrics* from the navigation menu to view the activity associated with hosts, such as those that have been automated and deleted. 
Each unique hostname is listed and sorted by the user's preference.

[NOTE]
====
A scheduled task automatically updates these values on a weekly basis and deletes jobs with hosts that were last automated more than a year ago.
You can delete the hosts you no longer want to use directly from the *Host Metrics* view by selecting the desired host(s) and clicking btn:[Delete]. 
These are soft-deleted, meaning their records are not removed, but are not being used and not counted towards your subscription usage.
