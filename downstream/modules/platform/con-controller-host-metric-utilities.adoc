= Host metric utilities

The controller provides a way to generate a CSV output of the host metric data and host metric summary through the Command Line Interface (CLI) and to soft delete hosts in bulk through the API.

== API endpoint functions

The API lists only non-deleted records that can be sorted by `last_automation` and `used_in_inventories` columns.

As an alternative to the user interface, you can use the host metric API endpoint, `api/v2/host_metric` to soft-delete hosts:
-----
api/v2/host_metric <n> DELETE
-----
A monthly scheduled task automatically deletes jobs that use hosts from the Host Metric table that were last automated more than a year ago.
