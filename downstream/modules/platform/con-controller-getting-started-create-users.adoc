A default administrator user with the role of System Administrator is automatically created and is available to all users of [ControllerName]. 
You can use it as it is or edit it later. 
You can add other users to an organization, but you must create the user first. 

Refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/userguide/users.html#ug-users-create[Users] section in the Automation Controller User Guide for more information.

For the purpose of the getting started guide, leave the default user as it is.
