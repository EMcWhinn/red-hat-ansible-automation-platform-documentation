= Importing a subscription

To understand what is supported with your subscription, see link:http://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/userguide/license-support.html#licenses-feat-support[Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Controller Licensing, Updates, and Support]. 
If you have issues with your subscription, contact your Sales Account Manager or link:https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/customerService/[Red Hat Customer Service].

When you launch controller for the first time, the Subscription screen automatically displays.

.Procedure
. By default, the option to retrieve and import your subscription is to upload a subscription manifest. 
Generate this from link:https://access.redhat.com/management/subscription_allocations[Subscription Allocations].
When you have a subscription manifest, you can upload it by browsing to the location where the file is saved (the subscription manifest is the complete .zip file, and not its component parts).
+
[NOTE]
====
If the *Browse* button in the subscription manifest option is grayed-out, clear the username and password fields to enable the *Browse* button.
====
+
Alternatively, you can choose the option to enter your Red Hat customer credentials using your username and password. 
Use your Satellite username and password if your controller cluster nodes are registered to Satellite using Subscription Manager. 
Once you enter your credentials, click *Get Subscriptions*.
. The subscription metadata is then retrieved from the RHSM/Satellite API, or from the manifest provided.
** If it is a subscription manifest, and multiple subscription counts were applied in a single installation, the controller combines the counts but uses the earliest expiration date as the expiry (at which point you must refresh your subscription).
** If you enter your credential information (username and password), the controller retrieves your configured subscription service. 
Then it prompts you to choose the subscription you want to run and entitles the controller with that metadata. 
You can log in over time and retrieve new subscriptions if you have renewed.
+
[NOTE]
====
When your subscription expires (you can check this in the Subscription details of the Subscription settings window), you must renew it in the controller by one of these two methods.
====
+
If you encounter the â€œError fetching licenses" message, you need the proper permissions required for the Satellite user. 
The controller administrator needs this to apply a subscription.
+
The following Satellite roles grant proper access:

* Custom with *view_subscriptions* and *view_organizations* filter
* Viewer
* Administrator
* Organization Admin
* Manager
+
Red Hat recommends the *Custom* role for your controller integration, as it is the most restrictive. 
Refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.13/html/administering_red_hat_satellite/managing_users_and_roles_admin[Creating and Managing Roles] section of the Satellite documentation on managing users and roles for more detail.
+
[NOTE]
====
The System Administrator role is not equivalent to the Administrator user checkbox, and does not provide sufficient permissions to access the subscriptions API page.
====
+
. Click btn:[Next] to proceed to *Tracking and Insights*. 
Tracking and insights collect data to help Red Hat improve the product by delivering you a much better user experience. 
For more information about data collection, refer to link:http://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/usability_data_collection.html#usability-data-collection[Usability Analytics and Data Collection]. 
This option is checked by default, but you may opt out of any of the following:
** *User analytics* collects data from the controller user interface.
** *Insights Analytics* provides a high level analysis of your automation with {ControllerName}, which is used to help you identify trends and anomalous use of the controller. 
For opt-in of Automation Analytics to have any effect, your instance of {ControllerName} must be running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
Refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/usability_data_collection.html#user-data-insights[Automation Analytics] section for more information. 
If you select to opt-in for this option, the screen expands and prompts for a username and password to enable Insights, if applicable.

+
[NOTE]
====
You can change your analytics data collection preferences at any time, as described in the link:http://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/4.4/html/administration/usability_data_collection.html#usability-data-collection[Usability Analytics and Data Collection] section.
====
+
. After you have specified your tracking and insights preferences, click btn:[Next] to proceed to the End User Agreement.
. Review and check the *I agree to the End User License Agreement* checkbox and click btn:[Submit].

When your subscription has been accepted, the controller displays the subscription details and navigates you to the Dashboard of the {ControllerName} interface. 
You can return to this screen by clicking btn:[Settings] from the navigation menu and select btn:[Subscription settings] from the Subscription option.
