= Projects

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in the controller.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually under the Project Base Path on your controller server, or by placing your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by the controller. 
These include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you use source control to manage your playbooks. 
This type of best practice provides the ability to treat your infrastructure as code and is in line with DevOps ideals. 
While this guide uses lightweight examples to get you up and running, we suggest using source control to manage playbook for production purposes.
