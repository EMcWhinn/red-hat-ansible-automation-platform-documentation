= Activating Webhook rulebooks

Rulebooks that include a "source" section require extra configuration to accept external messages as triggers, usually in the form of a webhook. In Openshift environments, you can allow webhooks to reach an activation-job-pod over a given port by creating a Route that exposes that rulebook activation's k8s service.

== Prerequisites

* You have created a rulebook activation in {EDANameShort} Controller Dashboard.
